Just the repository for a restaurant table booking website, required by my front-end course.

To launch the website locally, follow the following steps -
-> (Pre-requisite) Make sure you have node, and npm installed on your local machine.
-> Clone my repository, and then run "npm i" with "meta-front-end-capstone/client", as your working directory. This installs all the dependencies required to locally serve the website.
-> Again with "meta-front-end-capstone/client" as your working directory, now run the command "npm run dev" to run the development server( vite ), enabling it to locally serve the website.
-> Click the hyperlink which appears in your terminal, and rate my minimalistic website :)
